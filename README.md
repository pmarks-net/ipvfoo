IPvFoo is a Chrome extension that adds an icon to your location bar, indicating whether the current page was fetched using IPv4 or IPv6. When you click the icon, a pop-up appears, listing the IP address for each domain that served the page elements.

Everything is captured privately using the webRequest API (new in Chrome 17), without creating any additional network traffic.

#### Install it from the Chrome Web Store:

#### Firefox Support:
IPvFoo now [runs on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ipvfoo-pmarks/), but there are [a few bugs](https://github.com/pmarks-net/ipvfoo/issues/32) to work out.
